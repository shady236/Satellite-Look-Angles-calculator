# Satellite-Look-Angles-calculator

This java program is used to calculate some parametrs for any Geostationary satellite which are:
  - Elevation Angle for user antenna to point to a specific satellie.
  - Azimuth Angle for user antenna to point to the satellie.
  - Diclination Angle for user antenna to point to the satellie.
  - Distanse between the user and the satellie.
  - and Time delay that the signal takes to go from user to satellite or vice versa.

This data is needed for program to run:
  - Satellie longitude.
  - User longitude.
  - User latitude.

The program accepts user input and outputs the results through a simple GUI.

Check "running app.mp4" file for more details.
